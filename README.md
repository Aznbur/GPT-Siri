# GPT-Siri
A Siri ChatGPT shortcut that takes full of advantage of the new ChatGPT shortcut actions in the 1.2023.152 update.

# Requirements
The shortcut needs **iOS 16.1** to be able to use. This is due to the fact that **the ChatGPT app requires iOS 16.1**, not because I want a minimal amount of people to use the shortcut.

# ⚠️‼️ KNOWN ISSUES ‼️⚠️
On iOS 17, copy to clipboard doesn't work. **This is a Shortcut bug. Report this to the Feedback app.**

# Download
Go to the “latestversion.txt” file in the files section. Copy and paste the link and enjoy :)
